# Episodic Sequence Data

This git page is the general (and messy) run through of my episodic populations genetic analysis. 

These episodic populations refer to Drosophila melangaster populations undergoing high predatory selection and a subsequent control population with no predatory selection (with two replicates for each treatment). The predator populatons have been undergoing high predation threat from Chinease praying mantids for 24 hours, with those surviving the bout of predation able to contribute genes to the next generation

Sequencing was completed at MSU by previous students within the Dworkin Lab.
