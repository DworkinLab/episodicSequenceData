## Analyzing Sequence Data from Pooled Illumina Sequences

The structure of this data set gives an overview of the process to work with the raw outputs from Illumina sequencing of Pooled sequence data (in .fastq.gz format). The Data set I am using is from .......

DNA extraction of populations occurred at MSU by Dr. Michael DeNieu and Mauricio Losilla using the Zymo DNA extractor for insects. Three independent extractions were done for each population and generation that had been stored on ethanol previously, with 20 flies used per extraction (10 males, 10 females) for a total pool size of 60 flies. Samples were submitted to RTSF (Research Technology Support Facility) Genomics Core (MSU), where next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared (Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA Library prep kit) and samples were loaded onto two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 rapid flow cell (version 1). Sequencing was done with Rapid SBS reagents in a 2x150bp paired end format, with the bases called using Illumina Real Time Analysis RTA v1.18.61, and converted to FastQ format. Groups of samples were sent in for sequencing in 2012 and 2015 for three generational time points, generation 38, generation 77 and generation 115, for 12 total sequences. The base population was also sequenced multiple times for greater coverage to uncover the most initial variation that was present in the starting population, for 13 total populations used in analysis
